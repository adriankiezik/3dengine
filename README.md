Required to build:

- GPU that supports OpenGL 3.3
- cmake (>= 3.10)

To build and run:

Linux/MacOS:

- `./build.sh`

Windows:

- `build.bat`

The compiled executable will be in the `build` directory.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you have to configure include paths in c_cpp_properties.json as well. (for intellisense to work correctly, doesn't affect compilation)
